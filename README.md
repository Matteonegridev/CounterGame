# Javascript Counter Game by **Matteo Negri**

This application has been created with the sole purpose of creating a _counter application_
for the Javascript project of **START2IMPACT**

The project is quite intuitive: you just need to guess the number hidden behind the question mark!

#How does that work:

- use the _+_ and _-_ to increase and decrease the counter
- the button **"You Sure!?** will place your guess:
  1. if your guess is high a _"Too high"_ message will appear
  2. on the other hand, if your guess is below the hidden number
     a _"Too Low..."_ message will pop up instead.
- You have only **10 guess** (score)
- Once you guess the number you will update your **highscore**
- Use the button **Try Again** to reset the page; your highscore
  won't disapper: try to do better!

Thank you so much!
